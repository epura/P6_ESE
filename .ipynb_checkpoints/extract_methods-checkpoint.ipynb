Fifth is supposed to make sure that it matches fourth, and not the same server from first/second/third (LIFO behavior). However, because we have more than one server, it doesn't seem like there's any guarantee that fourth/fifth refer to the same server as one of first/second/third, so this test might occasionally not test LIFO behavior, and basically do the same as first/second (basic caching) but for a different server than that one chose.\r\n",

Is this going to return the active threads for the tserver in general? If that would be the case, how would you recommend a \"good\" range for setting the limit?  The number of active threads is a tserver seems like it would be highly variable and complex to reason about and may not be a suitable surrogate for measuring the number of active writers. I don't believe that Thread.activeCount() is equivalent to the ThreadPoolExecutor getActiveCount method, and getActiveCount() requires that these writing threads submitted to run in a pool.\r\n",

This change seem to be trying to optimize constructing an ordered array so that `BlockBucket.free()` can iterate through that array. However, looking at the code, it's not clear to me why we even need this intermediate array at all, because we already have an ordered view in the priority queue itself! Couldn't we just add a `poll()` method onto `CachedBlockQueue` with a trivial implementation to call `poll()` on its internal queue, and have `free()` iterate calling that directly?\r\n",

This also has the nice behavior of retrying (regenerating the object) if the config changed while we were executing, which is something I suggested doing in my other comment, since the result of `compareAndSet` wasn't being checked. Config changes are rare, so this should almost never block, and when it does, the result will always be generated from the most current configuration, and we'll throw away any stale copies (which is what we'd do anyway in my other comment's `do...while` suggestion).\n",

In order to support this, it's necessary for modules to be able to declare what kinds of tokens they are able to understand. This isn't currently implemented, and can probably be done better, and may not be the best design anyway, so probably okay to remove regardless, as long as it's really not being used.

I think the best way to go is to provide the volume chooser with enough information so that it can make these type of decisions itself.  For example, one possible way to have a sticky chooser would be to provide choosers with the last choice it made for a resource.  Another possible way would be to provide the tablets current set of files to the chooser.  I don't think we need to modify the chooser to provide more info at this time, unless we have a valid use case.  I am not even sure sticky tablets is a good goal.\r\n",

It should either be clearly documented when it is declared, with a direct, complete, and unambiguous answer to the question \"What does it mean to be 'doomed' here?\" or avoided entirely.

You can only do comparisons. So, there's a chance that when you do a \"put\" here, it will reuse the old key, but the new value (in the case where the map entry exists, but the WeakReference is empty). The result is that the entry could disappear from the map even though the object in the WeakReference is still being used. In this case, we lose deduplication. There does not appear to be a solution to this (short of writing our own map class, or iterating over the keyset and comparing keys ourselves), and our deduplication is \"best effort\", so it's not a big deal... but it's worth keeping in mind, so we don't even try to use this paradigm for guaranteed deduplication.\n",

For example, `generic_logger.xml` no longer exists, neither does `accumulo.service.instance` property, or any automatic numbering being assigned in the launch scripts. I think it may help to frame the discussion in the context of the current state of the code, rather than the previous releases, which had a very casual approach to the tight coupling between the server code and the environment which launched it.\r\n",

The longer term goal with my branch was to make `Table` and `Namespace` first class citizens in the public API. The ID would be just one facet of those API classes. At this point, it doesn't matter, because they are being used only for internal code. However, I do think it'd be easier for follow-on work to keep the inner-class, in case more public-facing features are adapted from my branch later.\r\n",

However, I think some of these optimizations you made will benefit iterators seeking the in mem map, but not iterators seeking RFiles.  I think I was not surprised at lack of coverage, but at the lack of use of your optimizations by RFile.  Personally I would like to see RFile refactored to use your optimizations.\n",

I'm working on migrating some of the parsing code I wrote using RegExs to a proper AST parser, which should be about 10x faster, but there's some fringe cases that make that hard. In particular, Java files can have \"orphaned\" comments (not connected to any other node in the parse tree) interspersed with imports, which are annoying to deal with. And also, the libraries I've looked at don't seem to make it easy to rewrite a file's imports without changing the rest of the file's style.\r\n",

It seems we should fail if this configuration is missing.  In terms of documenting the required properties for PerTableVolumeChooser, it should require both the table property and one for the logger.  Given that there is only one non-table scope at the moment (logger), perhaps it makes sense to drop the scope altogether and just have the single non-table property.\n",

The purpose of synchronization is to prevent leakage of intermediate values through methods like getTopKey and getTopValue while another thread is calling next. This is only necessary when a configurable iterator does something multi-threaded. There are at least a couple of ways to avoid the need to make this iterator synchronized: (1) make the system iterators thread safe as exposed by the top iterator in some other way, at least from a security perspective, or (2) detect and/or disallow any use of threading in configurable iterators. Maybe you can do (1) by eliminating the possibility of leaking top keys and values that are still being evaluated by the filter? Probably needs a test to make sure we don't break that in the future.\n",

The benefit here is that we could add a connection namespace context like `use <namespace>;` in traditional RDBMS for a more intuitive API. If using the `_default_` namespace, a smarter client could interpret the absence of a fully qualified table name as relative to the current namespace context, rather than always the default namespace.

However, I can also see it the other way around: that the upstream project has an interest in providing some test code to ensure any downstream packaging meets some minimum standards of quality so that Accumulo is well-represented downstream.

The conditional being checked here only verifies that the allocated array was larger than an empty array. What it actually needs to check is that the number of bytes read into the array is the same as the value of the length field, regardless of what else we want to check. The conditional in this patch is sufficient only if we switch to using `readFully` instead of `read`, which throws an EOFException if the number of bytes read from the input stream isn't enough to fill the buffer (e.g. doesn't match the expected keyEncryptionKeyLength).\n",

The prop `user.dir` is the CWD.  Maven sets the CWD to the dir where the pom is.  Its nice having the test write to target on jenkins and environments like that.  Although maybe jenkins sets java.io.tmpdir to something reasonable.\n",
